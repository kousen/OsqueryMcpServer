# Osquery System Diagnostics Skill

Use osquery to answer system diagnostic questions through natural language.

## How to Execute Queries

Run osquery with JSON output for structured data:

```bash
osqueryi --json "YOUR SQL QUERY HERE"
```

**Important**: Always use `--json` flag for parseable output.

## Quick Reference: Common Diagnostics

| User Question                   | Use This Query                |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| "Why is my computer slow?"      | High CPU or High Memory query |
| "What's using all my RAM?"      | High Memory query             |
| "What's using my network?"      | Network Connections query     |
| "Is my fan running hot?"        | Temperature Info query        |
| "Is my system compromised?"     | Suspicious Processes query    |
| "What's causing disk slowdown?" | High Disk I/O query           |
| "Give me a system overview"     | System Health Summary         |

### Advanced Queries (see Advanced Scenarios section)

| User Question                  | Use This Query                |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| "What files changed recently?" | File Integrity / `file` table |
| "Verify this file's hash"      | Hash Verification query       |
| "Show my browser extensions"   | Browser and Application Data  |
| "What runs at startup?"        | Startup Items and Persistence |
| "Show Docker containers"       | Container queries             |
| "What apps are installed?"     | Applications query            |

## Predefined Queries

See [queries.md](queries.md) for complete SQL templates with explanations.

## Interpreting Results

### CPU Usage
- **cpu_percent > 50%** for a single process is high
- System processes like `kernel_task`, `WindowServer` are normal consumers
- Browser processes (`Google Chrome Helper`) often top the list - normal

### Memory Usage
- **resident_mb > 1000** (1GB) is significant
- Compare to total system RAM (check with `SELECT physical_memory FROM system_info`)
- Multiple instances of same app (e.g., Chrome tabs) add up

### Network Connections
- `ESTABLISHED` = active connection
- `LISTEN` = waiting for connections (servers)
- Unexpected connections to unknown IPs warrant investigation

### Temperature (macOS)
- CPU temps **under 80C** are normal under load
- **Above 90C** sustained indicates cooling issues
- Fan speeds increase automatically with temperature

### Suspicious Processes
Flagged processes aren't necessarily malware. Common false positives:
- **"No parent process"**: Daemons that outlive their parent are normal
- **"Running from temp"**: Installers and updaters often run from /tmp
- Investigate further with: `SELECT * FROM processes WHERE pid = <pid>`

## Platform Notes

**macOS-specific tables**:
- `temperature_sensors`, `fan_speed_sensors` - Only on macOS
- `launchd` - macOS service manager

**Linux alternatives**:
- Use `/proc` filesystem tables
- `systemd_units` instead of `launchd`

## Error Handling

If you see "no such table", the table may not exist on this platform:
```bash
# List available tables
osqueryi --json "SELECT name FROM osquery_registry WHERE active = 1"
```

## Follow-up Suggestions

After showing results, consider suggesting:
- "Would you like me to investigate any specific process?"
- "Should I check what files this process has open?"
- "Want me to look at the network activity for this process?"

## Advanced Scenarios

For security investigations and specialized queries beyond the common diagnostics above, osquery offers powerful capabilities documented at https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

### File Integrity Monitoring

**Triggers**: "file changes", "modified files", "file monitoring", "who changed this file"

Track file modifications in real-time (requires osqueryd daemon, not just osqueryi):
- **macOS**: `file_events` table (FSEvents-based)
- **Linux**: `file_events` (inotify) or `process_file_events` (Audit)
- **Windows**: `ntfs_journal_events` (NTFS Journal)

```sql
-- Check recently modified files in a directory (point-in-time, works with osqueryi)
SELECT path, mtime, size, uid FROM file
WHERE path LIKE '/etc/%' AND mtime > (strftime('%s', 'now') - 3600)
```

**Documentation**: https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/file-integrity-monitoring/

### Hash Verification

**Triggers**: "file hash", "verify file", "checksum", "file integrity"

```sql
-- Get hashes for a specific file
SELECT path, md5, sha1, sha256 FROM hash WHERE path = '/usr/bin/ssh';

-- Check hashes of all files in a directory
SELECT path, sha256 FROM hash WHERE directory = '/usr/local/bin'
```

### Advanced SQL Functions

Osquery extends SQLite with useful functions:

| Function | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `regex_match(pattern, string, index)` | Pattern matching | `WHERE regex_match('^192\.168\.', remote_address, 0) IS NOT NULL` |
| `in_cidr_block(ip, cidr)` | IP range checking | `WHERE in_cidr_block(remote_address, '10.0.0.0/8')` |
| `split(string, delimiter, index)` | String parsing | `split(cmdline, ' ', 0)` for first argument |
| `version_compare(v1, v2)` | Version comparison | `WHERE version_compare(version, '2.0.0') < 0` |

**Documentation**: https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/sql/

### Browser and Application Data

**Triggers**: "browser extensions", "Chrome extensions", "Firefox addons", "installed apps"

```sql
-- Chrome extensions (macOS/Linux)
SELECT name, identifier, version, path FROM chrome_extensions;

-- Firefox addons
SELECT name, identifier, version, active FROM firefox_addons;

-- Safari extensions (macOS)
SELECT name, identifier, version FROM safari_extensions;

-- Installed applications (macOS)
SELECT name, bundle_identifier, bundle_version FROM apps
```

### Startup Items and Persistence

**Triggers**: "startup programs", "auto-start", "persistence", "what runs at boot"

```sql
-- macOS launch agents/daemons
SELECT name, program, run_at_load FROM launchd WHERE run_at_load = '1';

-- Linux systemd services
SELECT id, description, active_state, sub_state FROM systemd_units WHERE active_state = 'active';

-- Cron jobs
SELECT command, path FROM crontab;

-- Scheduled tasks (Windows)
SELECT name, action, path, enabled FROM scheduled_tasks WHERE enabled = 1
```

### Container and Virtualization

**Triggers**: "Docker containers", "running containers", "virtual machines"

```sql
-- Docker containers
SELECT id, name, image, state, status FROM docker_containers;

-- Docker images
SELECT id, tags, size FROM docker_images;

-- Docker networks
SELECT id, name, driver FROM docker_networks
```

### Discovering More Tables

When you need capabilities beyond the predefined queries:

```sql
-- List all available tables on this system
SELECT name FROM osquery_registry WHERE registry = 'table' ORDER BY name;

-- Get schema for any table
PRAGMA table_info(table_name_here)

-- Search for tables by keyword
SELECT name FROM osquery_registry WHERE registry = 'table' AND name LIKE '%network%'
```

**Complete schema reference**: https://osquery.io/schema/

### Performance Considerations

Some tables are expensive to query:
- `file` and `hash` tables traverse the filesystem - always constrain with `WHERE path` or `WHERE directory`
- `process_open_files` and `process_open_sockets` are heavier than `processes`
- Event-based tables (`*_events`) require the osqueryd daemon
